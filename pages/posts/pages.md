#### <ins>A Case for why Nostr is important</ins>
 
I always enjoyed the concept of free and open source software. There was a time I worked at a Crypto mine, mining Ether and bitcoin so I've had a fascination with the concept of ["Freedom technology"](https://eightify.app/summary/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency/bitcoin-nostr-freedom-tech-insights-from-matt-odell) for a while now. They can be understood as tools for individuals to have a decentralized platform in which they can have ownership and control over their data.  
  
That brings me to this new protocal ["Nostr"](https://nostr.com/). Nostr which stands for _"<ins>N</ins>otes and <ins>O</ins>ther <ins>S</ins>tuff <ins>T</ins>ransmitted by <ins>R</ins>elay"_ is something I have been playing with it for a couple months now and wanted to express my takes on the protocal, what it could mean for the future and things that I learned. 

So the basics of the Nostr are best explained with a comparison to something like TCP-IP. TCP-IP which is the protocal that allows computers to transmit data over the internet was introduce in 1974 and the main thing to realize is that no sole entity controls or owns it. Because it's simply the rules that govern how computers share data over the web it is permissionless by nature which means anyone can send packets over the web as long as they follow the protocal
  
Nostr works in a similar way, because it is an open protocal anyone can use and build with it. The concept of technology being open and permissionless is important as more of our lives become digital. 
Nostr can be an open protocal for social media as well as a way to communicate to others in a censership resistent way.  

If that doesnt make a whole lot of sense let me present a practical example. I have an Android phone, If I were to log into something like Twitter all my data is controlled and served by Twitter the company's servers. Which means they control all my tweets, videos, and followers. I simply use there service, and they can stop me from using the app by banning my account or disabling use. With nostr my Information is being broadcast by many different computers (Relays) from all around the world. This makes it so there is not just one point of failure. I can even set up my own relay server to broadcast my notes to my following. The best part is If I don't like a particular client or application, I can always use another one and keep all my data.
  
The way this works is interesting by using relay servers that can be hosted by anyone, but without getting into the technicalties, why should people care. As Social media grew entire industries emerged with people who's literal job title can be seen as "Influencer". As Influencers grew they became employees essentially to the platforms that raised them, like Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtube to name a few. What this means is that the opinions needed to be naturally biased as you can't speak your mind freely with the fear of being censored which in the case of these social media influencers would be equivalent to being laid off.  
  
The ability to control the data you put out is crucial to preserve Freedom of speech and expression which is a requirement to a successful society. Restricting speech in turn restricts thought, and if individuals can't think freely then someone else will glady think for them. 
  
   

That is why these open, permissionless, decentralized protocals are so important, because they are going to be the safe haven of those who aren't allowed to think openly. 
It is for this reason I believe a case can be made for the Nostr protocal. It isn't perfect but the fact that it's working is an interesting showcase into what is possible.    

#### <ins>My personal expreience using the protocal</ins>

Overall I've enjoyed the experience using Nostr. I have an Android phone and it was simple to download the app [Amethyst](https://www.nostrapps.com/apps/amethyst) which felt like a twitter clone and start following people on the platform like Jack Dorsey and Edward Snowdon.   
That being said it hasn't been a perfect experience as there has been some issues with my initial experience using not only Amethyst but a few other apps that use Nostr.

##### <ins>Initial issues using Nostr Clients</ins>
1.  How much Data is used by these apps  
    - This is an observation I had and it is more related to the optimization of the applications themselves rather than a fault on the Nostr Protocal but it is worth mentioning. Due to how the applications are built the essentially have to pull all the information each time the app is opened, This practical renders the application unusable without WiFi as it just chews threw Data usage. There has been developments into Nostr DB on the Damus client on IOS which looks interesting but I'll have to see.
2. The amount of engagement
    - Because the Protocal is new there isn't many people using it which can make the experience very different from that of a twitter of reddit. That being said it is refreshing to just have a few people you are interested in and follow them without the abuse of constant ads. 
3. The inital bugs
    - This one can't really be helped as there are now so many clients and it is really just a converstaion about which ones are the most optimized. That being said there has been some bugs that have caused a few of the clients I have used on Android to crash, (Amethyst, [Primal](https://www.nostrapps.com/apps/snort), [Snort](https://www.nostrapps.com/apps/snort)). As with all new tech it is something to bear in mind that it isn't as refined as something like a Twitter just yet.
   
   


#### <ins>Conclusions</ins>

Overall, I do believe this protocal will help shape the future of what social media can be. I didn't go to in depth with how the technicalties work with setting up and transmitting Relays as I want this tech to be approachable to the average person. One of the main issues with Bitcoin I found is the einvironment in which people aren't comfortable because they don't understand and therefore don't use the tech. This is a low stakes tool that I think everyone should at least try and come to their own conclusions about. Some Nostr apps can be found [here](https://www.nostrapps.com/) if you want to check out what they are capable of, There are ones similar to Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker news just to name a few.   
  
For the actual code behind Nostr check out the [Github](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr)  
They also have a wonderful website that is nice to read through to get a better understanding of the protocal itself.  [Nostr.com](https://nostr.com/)

I hope that whoever stumbles accross this little bio that life is treating you well and you are prospering.   
My name's Brandon but most people online know me as Scheibs. I plan on making this site  a reflection of my thoughts on the world as I continue to discover and feed my curiousity.   
Some of the topics found on this site are related to things like Computer Science, Bitcoin, and Tech as those are some of the things that interest me as of late. I'm excited that you found my little slice of the internet so thanks for spending your time hanging out here.  
As a simple plebian I humbly thank you internet entity for checking this page out!

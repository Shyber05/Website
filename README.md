## Personal Website

Started with a starter Next.js template from Vercel
It uses [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) and it is based on their [Blog](https://nextra.site/docs/blog-theme/start) theme.  

```bash
npx create-next-app --example blog my-blog
# or
yarn create next-app --example blog my-blog
# or
pnpm create next-app --example blog my-blog
```

The interesting thing about Nextra is it allows the use of [mdx files](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) which are files that allow you to use JSX in your markdown content.  
So I get to edit my site in markdown and makes the process pretty simple.

#### Documentation Theme

As a side note Nextra has another theme template for documentation   
The reason I wanted to add this here is if I ever need to be the sole maintainer for a project and need to spin up documentation very quickly I want to keep this option in mind.  
  

The full documentation theme can be found [here](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/start)

Quick shoutout to the youtube channel [Colby Fayock](https://www.youtube.com/@colbyfayock) for the video 
_[Documentation Website in Next.js with Nextra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVDMvYQL7-A)_   
High quality video that shows the simplicity of using the documentation theme.
